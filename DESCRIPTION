Description: This packages implements set of functions to retrieve overlapped enriched regions
              across multiple replicates in parallel (a.k.a, pair-wise), statistical method
              for overlapped regions. simultaneous presence of an enriched regions in replicates
              experiment would justify a local decrease of the stringency criterion, leveraging
              on the principal that repeated evidence is compensating for weak evidence.
              This packages jointly analyzes the enriched regions of multiple replicates, distinguishing
              between biological and technical replicates, and accepting user defined parameters.
