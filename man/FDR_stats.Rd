\arguments{
\item{peakList_A}{set of all confirmed enriched regions. `filterByFisherMethod` return set of confirmed peaks in combined stringency method}

\item{peakList_B}{set of all discarded enriched regions. `filterByFisherMethod` return set of discarded peaks in combined stringency method.}

\item{pAdjustMethod}{adjusted pvalue for multiple comparison}

\item{.fdr}{parameter for false discovery rate. User can tune false discovery rate.#' @param replicate.type A charcter vector used to select type of Chip-seq replicate ( Biological / Technical replicate)}

\item{outDir}{user can control where the exported BED file goes}

\details{
Intermediate set purification and to create output set through BH correction test

We distinguish Technical and Biological Chip-seq replicates. Technical replicates aim at controlling
the variability of the experimental procedure used to obtain the data should yield exactly the same result in
the absence of experimental noise. If user choose replicate type as `Technical`,
then enriched regions were passed in one test (A.K.A, comply minimum overlapping peak requirement) but failed the another (A.K.A, combined stringency test with Fisher's method),
these peaks won't be appeared in final output set. We call this procedure as intermediate set purification. I believe using comparing list-like data structure is intuitive and fast,
using `anti_join` method from dplyr packages made this job easily. Then using the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction with user-specified false discovery rate to create output set accordingly.
confirmed peak in output set are exported standard BED file.
