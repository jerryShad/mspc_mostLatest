##' Filter ERs by combined stringency test & create output set
##'
##' Main idea behind our method is that repeated evidence across Chip-seq replicates can compensate for a
##' lower significance in a single sample, which is implemented though the Fisher method. The significace of
##' ovelapping enriched regions is rigorously combined with the Fisher's method to obtain global Fisher score (A.K.A, combined p-value)
##' to evaluate combined stringency of all enriched regions and classified each peak as confirmed or discarded.

##' @param peakset set of pre-processed enriched regions stored in GRanges, where background signal (A.K.A, noise peak) were pre-processed and won't involve further workflow
##' @param .hitLiist list of overlap hit that set of enriched regions comply minimum overlapping peak requirement.
##' @param cmbstrgThreshold combined stringency threshold against all enriched regions p-value, and each peaks are classified as confirmed or discarded peak accordingly.
##' @param isFisherPass logical vector that check whether all enriched regins are passed in Fisher' combined method. TRUE : return GRangesList of all enriched regions are classified as confirmed. FALSE: return GRangesList of all discarded peaks. both is required
