##' Filter ERs by overlap-hit index list
##'
##' Once we obtained list of overlap-hit index where all possible overlap pair is included, we need to
##' further investigate hit index with our defined method. In previous workflow, `peakOverlapping` function give us correct geometry of overlap peaks as list-like object by parallel.
##' we need to do vector sum for getting overall overlaped peak numbers and proceed our evaluation. Where all enriched regions comply minimum overlap peak requirement,
##' are returned as overlap hit list and used for next workflow, while all enriched regions fail to comply the minimum overlap peak requirement, are returned as GRanges objects.
##' Due to further need of evaluating all enriched regions in different level in order to give clear Biological evidence, we decide to expand those overlap hit index as GRanges objects.

##' @title filterByOverlapHit
##' @param .ovHit list of overlap hit index. Once we obtained overlap hit list by calling `peakOverlapping` function in previous workflow, resuled hit-list ready to be used.
##' @param peakset set of Chip-seq replicate imported and all peaks are stored in GRanges object.
##' @param replicate.type A charcter vector used to select type of Chip-seq replicate ( Biological / Technical replicate)
##' @param isSuffOverlap logical vector that check whether comply minimum overlapping peak requirement. TRUE: return overlap hit list where all enriched regions comply minimum overlapping peak requirement. FALSE : return all discarded enriched regions as GRange object due to failing to comply minimum overlapping peak requirement. both is required
